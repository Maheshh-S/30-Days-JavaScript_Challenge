const multiLineString = `all day
and all night
we'd stay up
it felt so right

we were so young
we were so dumb
we would get drunk
and then hook up

we were ok 
we were alright
stayin awake 
till the sun rise

we were in love
couldn't stop us
like a good drug
never enough

we'd hook up in my car
drive it so far 
play you guitar
you'd show me ur art
let down our guards
think with our hearts
Stare at the stars
we were never apart

drinking to young
way too much fun
out in the sun
or in when it's gone
took you to prom
dance to our song
dance all night long
till the lights come on

but it's too late now i remember everything
and how careless we could be
but it's too late now i remember you and me
and how careless we could be

it's too late now I remember everything
and how careless we could be x3

verse 2:
late nights
long fights
it felt right
we were alive

we would go out
we were so loud
we were so proud 
we had no doubts

week ends
and week days
we'd spend
our own way

we were careless
we were fearless 
we were reckless
time was precious

we loved to waste time
whiskey and wine
drinking all night
asleep by your side

finally alive
we would just drive
never arrive
our journey was life

staying out late
testing our faith
running away 
we lived for today

young and so bold
never get old
screw what we're told
we can't be controlled!

but it's too late now i remember everything
and how careless we could be
but it's too late now i remember you and me
and how careless we could be

it's too late now I remember everything
and how careless we could be x3`;
